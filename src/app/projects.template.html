    For these sites, my company dicided to use a cms called Kentico. Kentico uses a .Net framework, and my responsibility was 
    to set up the dev environments locally for everyone on the team (setting up IIS, setting up a SQL Server Database, and configuring 
    the project to be connected to both of those), creating custom 
    components/modules to be used by content editors, and pushing the project to a dev server for testing major site changes.
